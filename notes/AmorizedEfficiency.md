# Amortized Efficiency of List Update Rules

Notes for reading/writing assignment due for [HW_3_Self-Adjusting](../HW_3_Self-Adjusting/)

# Introduction

The paper will discuss these two algorithms

- "move-to-front"
  - rule for maintaining an unsorted linear list representing a set
- "least-recently-used"
  - replacement rule for reducing page faults in a two-level page memory
